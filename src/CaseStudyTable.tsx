                        They mainly get their water from their food/prey, but
                        they can occasionally drink seawater while feeding. They
                        also live in the water, and hunt in it too.

                        To get their air, they breathe through nostrils on the
                        top of their head called "blowholes", and go to the top
                        of the surface to use their nostrils. Their oxygen is
                        produced by plants such as phytoplankton.

                        Whales usually get their energy, like most other
                        animals, by eating their food.
